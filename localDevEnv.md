## Simple Local Project Setup

* After downloading p5.js complete, you will see an directory called empty-example
* Copy the contents (index.html and sketch.js) into your new directory. If you change the name of sketch.js, you must edit line 16 of index.html.
* If the directory structure has changed, update index.html accordingly.

## Running a local server

* In terminal enter `python` to confirm it is installed and what version it is. If its not installed, install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">python</a>.
* Navigate to the directory needed
* Run the below code based on which version of python you are using.
	* Python 3 `python -m http.server`
	* Python 2 `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* If the server is running properly you should see something like this in the terminal `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...`
*  In browser, go to `http://localhost:8000/`
